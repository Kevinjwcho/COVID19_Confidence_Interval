# COVID19_Confidence_Interval

* This study is the retrospective analysis, which measures the mortality of Covid in South Korea at the early stage. 
* I want to estimate the excess mortality of Covid compated to the all-cause mortality before Covid outbroke.
* In this study, I compared the mortality of regions in S. Korea.
* The excess mortality was estimated by confidence interval using SARIMA and random forest.
* Daegu was the only region where the region shows the larger mortality than estimated CI.
